## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-04

Working tree, not yet committed. The software layer went from "planned" to "implemented
and tested on host", and the documentation was rebuilt around it.

### Added — flight computer

- **Flight loop orchestrator** (`controller.cpp`, ~460 lines) — non-blocking, bounded
  poll loop combining sensor acquisition, calibration, mission state, telemetry, SD
  logging, battery sampling, health and LED status.
- **Mission state machine** — `INIT → SELF_TEST → READY → FLIGHT → LANDED → RECOVERY`,
  with `FAULT` reachable from any operational state. Telemetry continues in every state.
- **Startup calibration** (`startup_calibration.cpp`) — gyro bias, accelerometer offset
  and barometric ground reference captured on the pad, with a stillness gate and a
  best-effort timeout that never blocks the mission.
- **Launch lockout / arming** — launch detection is refused until the arming delay has
  elapsed and calibration has settled, so a startup glitch cannot trigger a false launch.
- **Sensor plausibility gating** — readings outside datasheet-derived bounds are rejected
  *and* the previously held value is dropped, so the vehicle never coasts on data from a
  sensor that is actively wrong.
- **Complementary-filter orientation** (`orientation.cpp`) — roll and pitch fused from the
  gravity vector and integrated body rates; yaw integrated as an explicitly *relative*
  angle, since the vehicle has no magnetometer.
- **Sensor math** (`sensor_math.cpp`) — MPU6050 full-scale conversions, the Bosch BMP280
  fixed-point compensation algorithm, and the barometric altitude formula.
- **Fault manager** (`fault_manager.cpp`) — 16 enumerated codes in a fixed-size array with
  severity, occurrence counts and first/last timestamps. No allocation, constant cost.
- **Telemetry builder** (`telemetry_builder.cpp`) — snapshot to canonical record to
  rulebook packet string, plus the onboard SD CSV row.
- **Periodic-task scheduler** (`scheduler.cpp`) — fixed-period, non-allocating, and
  stall-tolerant (re-anchors instead of firing a catch-up burst).
- **Raw block log** (`raw_block_log.cpp`) — append-only log over 512-byte blocks with a
  rewritten header, so a brownout or impact reset resumes at the correct block. No
  filesystem, no FAT dependency.
- **Streaming NMEA parser** (`gps_parser.cpp`) — GGA and RMC with checksum validation,
  fixed buffers, no allocation, and no exceptions.
- **Health snapshot** (`health.cpp`) — mission state, counters, sensor flags, calibration
  and arming status, battery voltage, gyro bias, GPS checksum errors.
- **Configuration validation** (`config.cpp`) — refuses the `CAN-Team-XX` placeholder, a
  telemetry period above 1000 ms, and a post-impact window below the rulebook's 5 s.
- **Pico HAL** (`src/pico/`) — MPU6050, BMP280, NEO-6M, microSD (raw block access), radio
  glue, board I/O and bus initialisation. Compiled only when the Pico SDK is present.
- **Hardware watchdog** — 2 s on the vehicle; a watchdog reboot is recorded as a fault and
  telemetry restarts automatically.
- **Diagnostic telemetry tags** — `MODE`, `FAULTS`, `CAL` and `ARM` appended after every
  mandatory and GPS field, as permitted optional fields.

### Added — shared library

- **SX1278 / RA-02 LoRa driver** (`sx1278.cpp`, `sx1278.hpp`) — register-level driver
  reached through a `Sx1278Hal` callback struct, so the same code runs on the vehicle, on
  the bridge, or against a fake register bank. Bounded transmit timeout, continuous RX,
  RSSI and SNR readback.
- **Telemetry validity model** — per-field validity flags, so a packet is suppressed when
  any mandatory field cannot be trusted rather than transmitting a wrong value.

### Added — ground station

- **Bridge firmware** (`firmware/ground-station/src/pico/main.cpp`) — continuous RX,
  framed USB output, 1 Hz status lines, radio re-initialisation after repeated failures,
  and a 3 s watchdog.
- **CRC framing** (`framing.cpp` / `framing.hpp`) — `$len,crc,payload` with
  CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE, so transport corruption is diagnosed separately from packet
  validity. Host-buildable and unit-tested.
- **Transport layer** (`transport.py`) — a byte-for-byte Python mirror of the framing plus
  serial, file-replay and loopback transports.
- **Stream validator** (`validator.py`) — team identity, missing, duplicate and
  out-of-order packets, timestamp monotonicity, GPS sanity.
- **Link health** (`health.py`) — sliding-window packet rate, loss percentage, CRC
  errors, staleness and connection state, kept deliberately separate from telemetry
  validation.
- **Orchestrator** (`app.py`) — background thread wiring transport, parser, validator,
  logger and health, with a thread-safe snapshot and a bounded event queue that drops the
  oldest event rather than stalling reception.
- **Tk dashboard** (`dashboard.py`) — non-blocking event drain, live plots when
  matplotlib is available and a full numeric view when it is not.
- **CLI** (`main.py`) — `replay` and `live` subcommands, with or without the dashboard.
- **Web telemetry console** (`ground-station/web/index.html`) — single file, no build, no
  dependencies. Demo replay, file replay and Web Serial, with link health, mission state,
  a 3D flight view, a phase-banded flight profile with apogee and touchdown markers, an
  attitude indicator, GPS and a raw-packet monitor.

### Added — tooling and tests

- `tools/build_host.sh` — one command compiles and runs every host suite plus the Python
  tests.
- `tools/check_pico_syntax.sh` — syntax-checks all 10 `PICO_BUILD` translation units
  against minimal SDK stubs on a machine with no Pico SDK.
- `tools/pico_sdk_stubs/` — the minimal stub headers those checks need.
- `firmware/flight-computer/tests/flight_tests.cpp` — 21 suites, 189 assertions.
- `firmware/flight-computer/tests/mock_hardware.hpp` — mock implementations of all six
  hardware interfaces.
- `firmware/ground-station/tests/framing_test.cpp` — framing round-trip, CRC detection,
  resync, and the standard `0x29B1` known-answer vector.
- Python suites: `test_app.py`, `test_health.py`, `test_transport.py`,
  `test_validator.py` — 37 tests in total with `test_telemetry.py`.
- **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — host build and tests, Pico syntax
  check, and a CMake configure-and-CTest job on every push and pull request.

### Added — documentation

- [documentation/README.md](documentation/README.md) — documentation index and the rules
  the documentation follows.
- [design/software-architecture.md](documentation/design/software-architecture.md) — layer
  model, module map, flight-loop and pipeline flowcharts, fault model, timing budget,
  design rules.
- [design/wiring.md](documentation/design/wiring.md) — signal wiring for both Picos, pin
  table, bus-sharing rules, power tree, LED and battery-sense notes, RF chain, bring-up
  order.
- [project/timeline.md](documentation/project/timeline.md) — history, phase plan, gate
  status, critical path, blocked work, risk register.
- [testing/test-plan.md](documentation/testing/test-plan.md) — automated coverage,
  per-suite descriptions, hardware and mission test plans.
- [operations/runbook.md](documentation/operations/runbook.md) — configuration, builds,
  ground-station operation, launch-day checklist, troubleshooting, post-flight analysis.
- [audit/2026-09-04-repository-audit.md](documentation/audit/2026-09-04-repository-audit.md)
  — file-by-file verification of code, documentation and claims.
- This changelog, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Rewritten root [README.md](README.md) reflecting what is actually built.

### Changed

- **Removed the `<regex>` dependency from the shared telemetry library.** Team-id
  validation, field-precision checking and timestamp shape checking are now hand-written
  character scans. Behaviour is identical and all tests pass unchanged; compiling the same
  translation unit with the previous regex implementations produces a **337,555-byte**
  object versus **19,183 bytes** now (`g++ -Os`, x86-64) — a 94% reduction in a file that
  is linked into the flight image, where `<regex>` also costs heap and startup time.
  Previously `exact_precision()` constructed two `std::regex` objects on every mandatory
  field, nine times per parsed packet.
- Ground-station modules split by responsibility: `radio.py` became a compatibility shim
  re-exporting `transport.py`, and orchestration moved out of `main.py` into `app.py`.
- `requirements.txt` documents that the core needs no third-party packages; `pyserial` and
  `matplotlib` are optional extras for live serial and plots.
- CMake reorganised: `flight_core` as a hardware-independent host-buildable library,
  with firmware images configured only when `PICO_SDK_PATH` is available.

### Fixed

- **The link-rate meter misread bursts as thousands of Hz.** `LinkHealth` estimated the
  packet rate as an EWMA of instantaneous `1/dt` intervals, so two frames arriving in the
  same millisecond — a duplicate, or a serial buffer flushing a burst — pushed the reading
  to thousands of Hz, which then needed about ten packets to decay. Observed live: the web
  console displayed **249 Hz on a 2 Hz link** after the demo's injected duplicate. Both
  `health.py` and the web console now compute the rate over a **5-second sliding window**,
  which is immune to a single interval and falls to zero when the link drops instead of
  freezing at the last value. Three regression tests added; verified in the browser at a
  steady 2.00 Hz across both injected anomalies.
- **Field-precision validation was rejecting every well-formed packet.** The precision
  pattern escaped its backslash twice, producing `\\.` — a literal backslash followed by
  any character — instead of a literal dot. The replacement scan has no escaping to get
  wrong.

### Known limitations

- No hardware has been brought up. Sensors, radio link, SD media, power and mechanics are
  entirely unverified.
- The Pico HAL and the SX1278 driver are compile-checked only; their register sequences
  have never executed.
- The web console's parser, validator and CRC framing are hand-ported and are not covered
  by an automated suite.
- The CI `cmake-configure` job has not been run locally — no CMake toolchain is installed
  on the development machine.

## [2026-09-03] — Initial project

### Added

- Project structure: `avionics/`, `firmware/`, `ground-station/`, `mechanical/`,
  `electrical/`, `simulations/`, `documentation/`, `test-data/` — commit `c6c500b`.
- Hardware project overview — commit `e71706c`.
- Competition requirements and the supplied rulebook, with 30 extracted requirements,
  hardware gap analysis, nine development gates and ten open questions for the organizers
  — commit `a915247`.
- Initial software and engineering documentation: telemetry protocol specification,
  electrical architecture, hardware reference, electrical-compatibility assessment, GPIO
  and resource maps, microSD module analysis, pre-procurement design status — commit
  `27495df`.

### Engineering decisions recorded

- **AMS1117-3.3 rejected** for direct 1S LiPo to 3.3 V regulation: a fully charged cell at
  about 4.2 V does not clear the regulator's high-load dropout, and its 3.3 V output sits
  below the microSD reader's stated 4.5–5.5 V input range. No replacement selected.
- **The microSD reader is the highest-risk integration item** — its supply requirement is
  incompatible with a naive 3.3 V rail.
- **Rulebook contradictions escalated rather than resolved locally** — conflicting
  dimension limits across three pages, and 100 ft versus 150 ft launch altitude.
- **Chip datasheets are not board documentation** — breakout-level supply, logic levels,
  regulators, pull-ups and pinouts stay `TBD` until physically verified.
